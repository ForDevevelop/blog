                <p> Arrays hold values of the same type at contiguous memory locations. 
                In an array, we're usually concerned about two things - the position/index 
                of an element and the element itself. Different programming languages implement 
                arrays under the hood differently and can affect the time complexity of operations 
                you make to the array. In some languages like Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, the array 
                (or list in Python) size is dynamic and you do not need to have a size defined beforehand 
                when creating the array. As a result, people usually have an easier time using these languages 
                for interviews.
                Arrays are among the most common data structures encountered during interviews. 
                Questions which ask about other topics would likely involve arrays/sequences as well. 
                Mastery of array is essential for interviews!</p>
